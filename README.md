In-depth analysis of healthcare indicators and their influence on Diabetes using R and successfully visualized the results in Tableau

1)	Dataset 
Structured Dataset - Healthcare Diabetes Dataset 
Unstructured Dataset - Covid-19 Vaccine Tweets with Sentiment Annotation
•	I chose the Healthcare Diabetes Dataset for this project, and I focused on Variables of the data such as count of pregnancy, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, Age, and Outcome. The fact that the dataset focuses on diabetes, which is a significant health issue, motivated me to select it. The other indicators that are provided in the dataset help in identifying whether the patient has a potential risk of diabetes and can be helpful. 
•	The unstructured data chosen for this project is a Vaccine Tweet with Sentiment data. The unstructured dataset captured the Tweet ID, the tweet text, and the label which indicated the sentiment captured in the dataset. The unstructured dataset provided an overview of the sentiments exhibited by different people regarding vaccines on Twitter. It helped me understand people's views on the COVID situation and vaccine situation.
